# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token calling the `/login` endpoint and passing your credentials (email and password).
